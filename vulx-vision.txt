Upon first launch the tab will open and function as followed.

[+] The page will display a welcome message, centralised on the page
[+] The page will ask some basic questions, for example: where is your valorant installed, have you downloaded the correct launcher ect.
[+] After this a quick promt to say, Consider checking out the developer with some links (a button under showing, no thanks or skip)
[+] This will take you to the main page, it will display some stats such as display name ect along with settings to edit every value of your profile.
[+] Settings can be saved locally to allow quick loading.
